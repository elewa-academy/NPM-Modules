# MEGAMODEL

In this project you will build a configurable Data Model module, you can think of it as a very basic version of Mongoose.js.  You will re-use this module in the rest of your projects until we cover the true Mongoose.js.

The primary Learning Objectives for this series are (roughly in order):
* Lodash & object deep comparison
* Detecting & communicating errors
* Inheritance & using it
* Module design
* Async & using it
* Testing async code
* Local npm modules
