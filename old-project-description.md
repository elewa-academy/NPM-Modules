# MEGAMODEL

This is a long-running project where we will explore the deeper ends of JavaScript while building a general-purpose data model you can reuse in the rest of your frontend projects.

## Learning Objectives

JavaScript:
* Prototypical inheritance
* Functional OOP vs Classical OOP
* Asynchronous programming 
* Callbacks

Programming:
* Error handling
* Application architecture
* More dependency injection
* Breaking & non-breaking changes
* ES6 objects

This project does not cover promises.  It is better to first understand async programming with callbacks, then to learn the easier tools.  We will cover promises in the projects _Be Youtube_ and _Portfolio Facelift_ as well as the code along _Components, API's & Building_.

## Specifications

Build code to meet the [synchronous specs](https://github.com/elewa-academy/Frontend-Projects/tree/master/docs_src/04-megamodel/synchronous-model-specs.md), and the [async specs](https://github.com/elewa-academy/Frontend-Projects/tree/master/docs_src/04-megamodel/async-model-specs.md).  

As usual, build a repo for each.  Learning journal, readme, docs, ... but no need to include a live demo for this one.
